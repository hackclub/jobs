# Hack Club

Oh look! You've found the `HACK CLUB JOBS TERMINAL`.

I'm the ghost in this machine and I'm thrilled to have you here.

[Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit network of high school hackers and student-led programming clubs. About Hack Club:

- There are nearly 500 Hack Clubs in high schools around the world (in almost all 50 states and in 22 countries worldwide)
- [Hack Club Bank](https://hackclub.com/bank/) provides 501(c)(3) status to students running hackathons, Hack Clubs, and other projects. $6.5 million in transactions have been executed in the past four years!
- The [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack/) has over 17,000 Hack Clubbers in it. Over a million messages are sent every year!

...and there's a lot more! In the past year, Hack Clubbers have arranged high school hackathons like [Assemble](https://assemble.hackclub.com/launch) in San Francisco, created [Sprig](https://sprig.hackclub.com/), a game engine and free console to help get teenagers into game development, hosted [ask me anything](https://hackclub.com/amas/) sessions with Sal Khan and several other extraordinary people, posted thousands of project updates to the [Hack Club Scrapbook](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com), and so much more.

At HQ, we're a small team trying to build what we wish we had in high school. Nearly everything we do is open source at https://github.com/hackclub. Even our finances are 100% open at https://bank.hackclub.com/hq.

Hack Club HQ currently has [a small team of full-time employees](https://hackclub.com/team/). We'd love for you to join us!
